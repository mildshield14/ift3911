# IFT 3911 - Devoir 1 (Winter 2025)

## ðŸ“Œ Travel Reservation System Design

This repository contains the UML diagrams and documentation for Devoir 1 of **IFT 3911** - being a course that I'm auditing - focusing on object-oriented design principles.

## ðŸ“– Description

The objective of this assignment is to design a **Travel Reservation System** that supports:
- **Flights (Airline)**
- **Cruises (Naval)**
- **Trains (Railway)**

The system includes **administrative** and **client** functionalities for managing travel reservations, such as:
- Creating/modifying airports, ports, and stations
- Managing airlines, cruise companies, and train lines
- Searching for available flights, itineraries, and train trips
- Reserving and paying for seats or cabins

The design includes **UML diagrams** (class diagrams, sequence diagrams, package diagrams) and **OCL constraints**.
